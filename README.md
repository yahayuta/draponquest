# DraponQuest

A JavaFX port of the classic DoJa mobile game DraponQuest, featuring authentic Final Fantasy-style chiptune audio and modern enhancements.

## Multi-Language Support (English & Japanese)

DraponQuest now supports both English and Japanese for all major game text, menus, and messages.

- **Toggle Language:** Press the `L` key at any time in-game to instantly switch between English and Japanese. All UI, menus, and script text will update immediately.
- **Supported Text:**
  - Title, menus, battle messages, UI, and script/instructions
  - More text will be localized as the game evolves
- **How it works:**
  - All user-facing text is managed by `LocalizationManager.java`.
  - The current language is switched at runtime and all text is updated live.

### Adding/Editing Translations
- To add or update translations, edit `src/main/java/com/draponquest/LocalizationManager.java`.
- Add new keys or update existing ones in both the English and Japanese maps.
- Use `LocalizationManager.getText("key")` in code to fetch the correct string for the current language.

- `snd.gif` - Sand tiles  
- `stp.gif` - Steppe/grass tiles
- `wd.gif` - Forest/wood tiles

All graphics are preserved from the original DoJa version for authentic retro gaming experience.

## 🎵 Audio System

DraponQuest features a comprehensive audio system with both sound effects and background music. All audio files are procedurally generated 8-bit style sounds that perfectly match the retro aesthetic of the game:

### Sound Effects
All sound effects are procedurally generated 8-bit style audio files:
- **Movement** (`move.wav`): Quick ascending arpeggios (like FF menu navigation)
- **Battle Start** (`battle_start.wav`): Dramatic chord progressions (like FF battle transitions)
- **Attack** (`attack.wav`): Sharp impact with harmonics and descending sweeps
- **Defend** (`defend.wav`): Soft block with resonance frequencies
- **Escape** (`escape.wav`): Whoosh sound when successfully escaping battle
- **Victory** (`victory.wav`): Iconic FF victory fanfare with exact notes
- **Defeat** (`defeat.wav`): Descending minor scale (melancholic FF-style)
- **Menu Select** (`menu_select.wav`): Click sound for menu navigation
- **Save** (`save.wav`): Chime for save operations
- **Load** (`load.wav`): Different chime for load operations
- **Game Over** (`game_over.wav`): Dramatic descending sequence (like FF game over)
- **Title** (`title.wav`): Rich chord progressions with melody layers
- **Victory Music** (`victory_music.wav`): Extended fanfare with memorable themes

### Background Music
All background music tracks are procedurally generated chiptune-style loops:
- **Field Music** (`bgm_field.wav`): Simple ambient loop while exploring the map
- **Battle Music** (`bgm_battle.wav`): More intense loop during combat
- Music tracks loop indefinitely and can be toggled on/off

### Final Fantasy-Style Audio Characteristics
The audio system features authentic Final Fantasy-style sound design with **exact notes and frequencies** from classic FF games:
- **Iconic Victory Fanfare**: Classic "b b b b, g a b a b, C a# C a# a#" melody with precise notes
- **Exact FF Notes**: Uses precise frequencies like B4 (493.88 Hz), G4 (392.00 Hz), A4 (440.00 Hz), C5 (523.25 Hz), A#4 (466.16 Hz), D#5 (622.25 Hz), D5 (587.33 Hz), G#4 (415.30 Hz), F5 (698.46 Hz)
- **SNES Sound Chip Emulation**: Square, triangle, and saw waves with authentic harmonics
- **Rich Harmonics**: Multiple harmonic layers for depth (2nd, 3rd, 4th harmonics)
- **Authentic Note Patterns**: Exact same melodies and chord progressions as classic FF games
- **Dramatic Sound Effects**: Impactful sound design like FF games with precise timing

### Audio Controls
- **M Key**: Toggle background music on/off
- **T Key**: Toggle sound effects on/off
- **[ Key**: Decrease volume (both music and sound)
- **] Key**: Increase volume (both music and sound)

### Audio Status Display
The main game screen shows real-time audio status in the top-right corner:
- **Music ON/OFF indicator** (green/red) - Shows if background music is enabled
- **Sound ON/OFF indicator** (green/red) - Shows if sound effects are enabled  
- **Current volume percentage** (yellow) - Shows current volume level (0-100%)

### Audio File Locations
All audio files are stored in `src/main/resources/sounds/`:
- Sound effects: `move.wav`, `battle_start.wav`, `attack.wav`, `defend.wav`, `escape.wav`, `victory.wav`, `defeat.wav`, `menu_select.wav`, `save.wav`, `load.wav`, `game_over.wav`
- Background music: `bgm_field.wav`, `bgm_battle.wav`, `title.wav`, `victory_music.wav`

**✅ All generated sound files are now properly loaded and played in the game!** The AudioManager has been updated to ensure that:
- `SOUND_GAME_OVER` plays `game_over.wav` when the player is defeated
- `MUSIC_TITLE` plays `title.wav` on the title screen
- `MUSIC_VICTORY` plays `victory_music.wav` after winning battles
- All other sound effects and music tracks are correctly mapped and functional

If any of these files are missing, you can regenerate them using the provided Python scripts:

```bash
# Generate basic 8-bit style sounds
python soundgen/generate_missing_sounds.py

# Generate authentic Final Fantasy-style sounds with exact notes
python soundgen/generate_ff_exact.py
```

The `generate_ff_exact.py` script creates audio with **exact frequencies and notes** from classic Final Fantasy games, including the precise notes used in the iconic victory fanfare: "b b b b, g a b a b, C a# C a# a#, D# D# D D# D D, C a# g# a# g, C a# C a# a#, D# D# D D# D D, C a# C D# F".

### Regenerating All Sounds

To regenerate all sound and music files, use the provided batch file:

```bat
cd soundgen
generate_all_sounds.bat
```

This will run all sound generation scripts and automatically move the generated .wav files to the resource directory (`src/main/resources/sounds/`).

**Note:**
After running the batch file, no .wav files will remain in the `soundgen/` folder—all generated files are moved to the correct location for the game to use them.

## ⚔️ Battle System

The game features a turn-based battle system with the following mechanics:

### Random Encounters
- **3% chance** of encountering a monster when moving on the map
- Encounters occur after movement, not during

### Monster Types
- **Tung Tung Tung Sahur**: 8 HP, attacks for 1-2 damage
- **Tralalero Tralala**: 12 HP, attacks for 1-3 damage
- **Bombardiro Crocodilo**: 18 HP, attacks for 2-4 damage
- Each monster has unique appearance and stats

### Battle Mechanics
- **Player HP**: Persists between battles, only resets on game over
- **Turn-based combat**: Player and monster take turns
- **Actions**: Attack (deals 3-6 damage), Defend (reduces incoming damage), Run (try to escape)
- **Victory**: Defeat the monster to continue exploring
- **Defeat**: Game over screen with your total score and restart option

### Score System
- **Score increases by 1** every time you move one block
- **Score is displayed** under HP on the main screen
- **Battles Won counter** shows your combat victories in real-time
- **Game Over screen** shows your total score and final battle count

### Battle Controls
- **A**: Attack
- **D**: Defend
- **R**: Run (try to escape)
- **ESC**: Only exits after battle is complete (win or lose)

## 🔧 Configuration

### JavaFX Path Setup

Update the JavaFX path in the batch files:
```batch
set JAVAFX_PATH=C:\javafx-sdk-21.0.2
```

### Game Settings

Key game constants in `DraponQuestFX.java`:
- `DISP_WIDTH = 512` - Display width
- `DISP_HEIGHT = 512` - Display height
- `WAIT_MSEC = 100` - Game loop timing
- `fieldMapEndHeight = 16` - Initial player Y position (walkable)
- `fieldMapEndWidth = 16` - Initial player X position (walkable)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Player cannot move at start**
   - Make sure you pressed ENTER on the title screen to start the game
   - Player now starts in a walkable area; if you still cannot move, check for debug output in the console
   - If you see "Move blocked: not walkable or out of bounds", you may be surrounded by sea tiles (should not happen with default settings)

2. **"JavaFX runtime components are missing"**
   - Ensure JavaFX SDK is downloaded and path is correct
   - Update `JAVAFX_PATH` in batch files

3. **"Cannot find main class"**
   - Run `clean.bat` then `compile.bat`
   - Check that all source files are present

4. **Graphics not loading**
   - Verify image files exist in `src/main/resources/images/`

5. **Debugging**
   - All major game logic prints debug output to the console (movement, battle, state changes, audio events)
   - Audio system provides detailed logging of sound effects and music playback
   - Use this output to trace and diagnose issues

6. **PowerShell cannot find run.bat**
   - In PowerShell, you must run batch files with `./run.bat` or `.\run.bat` instead of just `run.bat`.
   - Example:
     ```powershell
     .\run.bat
     ```
   - This is a PowerShell security feature.
